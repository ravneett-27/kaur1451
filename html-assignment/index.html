    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Ravneet all the way from India. After graduating high school, I decided to persue further studies in Canada. Its been 1 Year since I came. I like to read books, sing sometimes or write a journal. Watching movies is yet another hobby of mine.They are a great source of entertainment.</p>
    <p>I study Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College, Ottawa. This program is a perfect blend of Graphic Design, Photography and Web Programming. So far so good. It is a fun program because of such courses. We have amazing professors for each course.</p>
