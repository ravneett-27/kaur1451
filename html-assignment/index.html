        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Ravneet all the way from India. After graduating high school, I decided to persue further studies in
            Canada. Its been 1 Year since I came.I landed here on 20<sup>th</sup> December 2023. I like to read books,
            sing sometimes or write a journal. Watching movies is yet another hobby of mine.They are a great source of
            entertainment.</p>
        <p>I study <em>Interactive Media Design</em> at Algonquin College, Ottawa. This program is a perfect blend of
            Graphic Design, Photography and Web Programming. So far so good. It is a fun program because of such
            courses. We have amazing professors for each course. Motivation is all we need in our life. I always follow
            what Albert Einstein said:
        <blockquote>Anyone who has never made mistakes has never achieved anything new <cite>Albert Einstein</cite>
        </blockquote> So live fast, die young because <abbr title="You Only Live Once">YOLO</abbr> </p>
        My Hobbies are:
        <ul>
            <li>I like to read books.</li>
            <li>I like to write short poems or journal about my everyday experiences.</li>
        </ul>
