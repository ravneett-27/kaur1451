    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Ravneet all the way from India. After graduating high school, I decided to persue further studies in Canada. Its been 1 Year since I came.I landed here on 20 <sup>th</sup> December 2023. I like to read books, sing sometimes or write a journal. Watching movies is yet another hobby of mine.They are a great source of entertainment.</p>
    <p>I study Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College, Ottawa. This program is a perfect blend of Graphic Design, Photography and Web Programming. So far so good. It is a fun program because of such courses. We have amazing professors for each course. Motivation is all we need in our life. I always follow what Albert Einstein said: <blockquote>Anyone who has never made mistakes has never achieved anything new <cite>Albert Einstein</cite></blockquote> </p>
